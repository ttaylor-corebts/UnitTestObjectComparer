# Unit Test Object Comparer
Sample project showing how to use [Greg Finzer's Compare-Net-Objects NuGet package](https://github.com/GregFinzer/Compare-Net-Objects).

When asserting that two objects are the same in a unit test, it can be difficult to determine which property values are not the same if the assertion fails.  Using the Compare-Net-Objects NuGet package, differences between two objects can be conveniently displayed in the assertion error message of the unit test.
